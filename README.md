## 🧠 What I Learned

- I learned that using semantics really help make the CSS portion much easier to deal with
- Doing this project, also helped me to notice on things I could improve on for the next project
- Structuring HTML semantically for better accessibility and maintainability
- Using media queries to handle multiple breakpoints
- Creating custom list styles with pseudo-elements
- Making layouts flexible and responsive with pure CSS
